Project Outline

Pitch: It's hard to keep track of how many reps you can do each time, or how much you usually deadlift. This app keeps it all organized and tracked for you.

MVP: Users can log in and can create, review, update, and delete data on their workouts. Can create a name of the exercise, amount lifted, reps completed, date, and region of the body exercise targets.

Stretch: Ability to upload progress pics by date.
